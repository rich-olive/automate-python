# automate-python
This repository documents my progress through The Python Automation Bootcamp (Work Smarter!): Zero to Mastery [https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-python-automation/].
The course is broken up into sections: 

Working with Files
Paths and Folders
Regular Expressions
Automating Spreadsheets
Automating Email
APIs
Automating ChatGPT

I have created separate branches for each section, and then merged them into main once complete. 

The first project was a product sales tracker, in which some basic data (product codes) was provided in .txt format for me to convert into a meaningful spreadsheet. Using the raw data, I converted product codes into product names, with unit prices, a date of sale and an order of sale, and outputted as a spreadsheet. 

This project inspired me to create the Shopping List applet. This applet runs as a CLI in which users can select user-defined number of meals from a list, and a shopping list of ingredients and quanitites is created in spreadsheet format.
